# [Project 1: Netflix Stock Data Visualization](https://github.com/jamest92/Netflix-Stock-Capstone-Project)
* Pulled financial data off Yahoo Finance for NFLX (Netflix) and loaded into excel csv.
* Created data basic visualization for stock price distribution; violin plot
* Analyzed trends from Revenues vs. Earnings
* Compared trends per quarter, and against the DJIA

# [Project 2: Titanic Binary Classification Analysis](https://github.com/jamest92/titanic-classification/blob/main/titanic-classification.ipynb)
* For this dataset, I trained multiple Machine Learning models to predicted survivability of passengers on the Titanic.
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand underlying features; data cleansed
* Analyzed relationships between data features and target variables
* Feature engineered missing/irrelevant data, encoding data to feed into machine learning model
* created a robust Random Forest Classifer model

# [Project 3: Bulldozer Price Regression](https://github.com/jamest92/Bulldozer-Price-Regression/blob/main/end-to-end-bluebook-bulldozer-price-regression-full.ipynb)
* Trained a machine learning model to predict future sale prices using a massive dataset (400K+)
* Instantiated scatterplots and histograms to understand underlying variables
* Feature engineered categorical variables in the timeseries dataset
* Tuned algorithm hyperparameters to use parameters

# Project 4: Dog Breed Multi-Class Classification
* Current project: using 10000+ images of 120 different dog breeds to create a machine learning classifier that can accurately predict breeds from a dog's picture
